            Welcome to this platformer challenge! In this level, your goal is to complete three key missions, each unlocking a special reward. Here’s what you need to do:
            <br><br>
            <strong>Mission 1: Defeat the Goompa</strong><br>
            <strong>Objective:</strong> Find and defeat the Goompa.<br>
            <strong>How to Complete:</strong> To defeat the Goompa, jump on its head when it’s within reach.<br>
            <strong>Reward:</strong> Once the Goompa is defeated, a hidden link to Repository 1 will be unlocked. You can collect this link to gain access to the first repository.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Mission 2: Defeat the Koopa</strong><br>
            <strong>Objective:</strong> Locate and defeat the Koopa.<br>
            <strong>How to Complete:</strong> The Koopa is trickier than the Goompa. You need to jump on it to make it retreat into its shell. Then, hit the shell to fully defeat the Koopa.<br>
            <strong>Reward:</strong> Defeating the Koopa will unlock a secret link to Repository 2, which will appear somewhere on the level. Find it and gain access to the second repository.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Mission 3: Finish the Level</strong><br>
            <strong>Objective:</strong> Reach the end of the level.<br>
            <strong>How to Complete:</strong> Once you’ve completed the previous two missions, make your way to the level's finish line by jumping across platforms and avoiding any other hazards.<br>
            <strong>Reward:</strong> Upon completing the level, a final link to Repository 3 will be unlocked as your ultimate prize.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Gameplay Tips:</strong><br>
            Keep an eye out for environmental clues that might hint where the links to the repositories are hidden.<br>
            Timing is key! Make sure to jump on enemies when they’re vulnerable.<br>
            Pay attention to the surroundings after each mission, as the repository links might appear in areas you’ve already passed.
